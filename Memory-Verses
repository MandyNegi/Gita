V2.12: 
	na tv evāhaṁ jātu nāsaṁ
	na tvaṁ neme janādhipāḥ
	na caiva na bhaviṣyāmaḥ
	sarve vayam ataḥ param 

Never was there a time when I did not exist, nor you, nor all these kings; nor in the future shall any of us cease to be.


V2.13:
	dehino ’smin yathā dehe
	kaumāraṁ yauvanaṁ jarā
	tathā dehāntara-prāptir
	dhīras tatra na muhyati 

As the embodied soul continually passes, in this body, from boyhood to youth to old age, the soul similarly passes into another body at death. The self-realized soul is not bewildered by such a change.

V2.20:
	na jāyate mriyate vā kadācin
	nāyaṁ bhūtvā bhavitā vā na bhūyaḥ
	ajo nityaḥ śāśvato ’yaṁ purāṇo
	na hanyate hanyamāne śarīre

For the soul there is never birth nor death. Nor, having once been, does he ever cease to be. He is unborn, eternal, ever-existing, undying and primeval. He is not slain when the body is slain.


V2.22: 		
	vāsāṁsi jīrṇāni yathā vihāya
	navāni gṛhṇāti naro ’parāṇi
	tathā śarīrāṇi vihāya jīrṇāny
	anyāni saṁyāti navāni dehī
	
As a person puts on new garments, giving up old ones, similarly, the soul accepts new material bodies, giving up the old and useless ones.	


V2.47
	karmaṇy evādhikāras te
	mā phaleṣu kadācana
	mā karma-phala-hetur bhūr
	mā te saṅgo ’stv akarmaṇi

You have a right to perform your prescribed duty, but you are not entitled to the fruits of action. Never consider yourself the cause of the results of your activities, and never be attached to not doing your duty.
